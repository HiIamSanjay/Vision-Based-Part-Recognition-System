# Vision-Based-Part-Recognition-System
This project implements a vision-based shape recognition system that identifies geometric shapes like circles, triangles, and squares. Using image processing techniques in OpenCV, the system detects shapes in images for applications in robotics, industrial automation, and quality control.
