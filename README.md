Vision-Based Part Recognition System
This project implements a vision-based shape recognition system that identifies geometric shapes like circles, triangles, and squares. Using image processing techniques in OpenCV, the system detects shapes in images for applications in robotics, industrial automation, and quality control.

Features
Automated shape detection using image processing.
Edge and contour detection with OpenCV.
Real-time classification for circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals.
Applications in automation, robotics, and education.
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (for image processing)
Computer Vision Algorithms (Canny Edge Detection, Contour Approximation)
